	<p>The low hum of machinery. <span>The splashing of cars driving through the puddles on the road. Wind carrying the scent of air through the open window. Whites, blues, and grays surround the people seated around the center table. A projector at the front of the room casts artificial light in front of it. The rest of the room is blanketed by the cold light coming in from the windows on two of the walls. Hardwood chairs. Metallic and wooden stools. Solid tiled floors. </span> White tiled ceilings.</p>
