    	<h1>Three Ideas or Starting Points for My "Lightweight Format"</h1>
    	<h2>1. Memorable Movie Scene</h2>
    	<h4>Guide: </h4>
    	<ul>
 	 		<li>Take a photo of something that represents the movie to you</li>
  			<li>Write the movie name</li>
  			<li>Describe the scene in a memorable quote from the movie</li>
		</ul>  
		<h4>Examples: </h4>
    	<ul>

The text reads: Faith"> <br>Legally Blonde<br><p>“Remember that first impressions are not always correct. You must always have faith in people. And most importantly, you must always have faith in yourself.”</p></li>
  			<li><img src="howtoloseaguy.png" width="350" alt="Three potted plants of varying heights"> <br>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days<br><p>"Andie: Oh, no. Our love fern. It's dead. Ben: No, it's just sleeping. Andie: You let it die. Are you going to let us die?"</p></li>

		<h2>2. Diary Entry</h2>

    	<ul>
 	 		<li>Write the current date</li>
  			<li>Take a photo at some point during your day</li>
  			<li>Write a short caption of the day's events and what you were feeling</li>
		</ul>  
		<h4>Examples: </h4>
    	<ul>

		</ul>  
		<h2>3. Wishlist</h2>
    	<h4>Guide: </h4>
    	<ul>
 	 		<li>When you want to purchase something, take a picture of the item and add it here</li>

  			<li>Come back a month later to see if it's still something you want</li>
		</ul>
